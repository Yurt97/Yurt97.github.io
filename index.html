<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Poof. That was how the book started. When Sam and Quinn were in their class, their teacher and one student dissapeared. No light or puff of smoke. Just gone. After some investigation, they find out everybody of the age of 15 has disappeared, the kids are stuck in side a inpenetrable circle barrier, Which was later called the FAYZ. Kids got reckless, and 10 year olds with guns and everybody over the age of 5 with a lethal weapon, it's not pretty. It was created by the strongest person in the FAYZ, if not the world. But the mutations were caused by a virus carried by a meteorite when it hit Earth. When they want a leader to organize things most, Caine, along with his other Coates school members, come down to Perdido Beach to take over. He and his team seam normal at first. But after the forced meeting Sam had with Caine, he finds out that Caine has powers. This did not surprise Sam. He has powers of his own. They fight for each others' goals, and become allies at times. The other "freaks," or people with powers, fight too, and their relationship change things drastically. Their only enemies are not humans either. Whether it be flesh eating worms and evil spirit fighting as a human, they fidn a way to survive and win. Read more to find out.</p>

There are tanks, soldiers, guns, missles, helicopters, drones, and planes, all for a vain attempt to stop the apocalypse. There is one monster that can control people with just his voice. The only ones who can stop him are a couple of teens with powers, including one with unmatchable powers. But during the fight, the line between hero and villain become blurry, and som wonder how the actual monsters are. This isn't just a normal battle--this is the war to save the human race. In Hero, the virus continues to wreak havoc. A new foe, a monster capable of spreading deadly diseases, is causing the whole world to have a FAYZ-like experience. The teen heroes, including Francis--who can enter the fourth demension--are the only ones capable of stopping him.
